# ISIM
ISIM is a project that was created in in order to simulate a microprocessor-circuit interaction. It uses ltspice's API to run simulations on CIR files.
This is the first version of the ISIM, so the circuit still has two base resistors and three collector resistors.
The circuit does not incldue yet full support for P mode (be it for Mosfet or BJT transsitors).
